			<h2 class="title">About:</h2>
			<p class="about_txt"><strong>Green Day </strong>is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of
				California in
				1987 by
				lead
				vocalist and
				guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's
				career, they have been a trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the
				recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a
				full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016. Green Day was
				originally
				part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California.
				The
				band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their
				major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually
				shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk
				bands
				Sublime, the Offspring, and Rancid, with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.
			</p>

			<p class="about_txt">Though the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not match
				the success of
				Dookie, they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the
				latter
				achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found
				popularity
				with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century
				Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a
				trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in September, November, and December 2012,
				respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their
				previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio
				album, Revolution Radio, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on
				the
				Billboard 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers, was released on
				February
				7, 2020.</p>

			<p class="about_txt">Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide. The group has been
				nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best
				Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of
				Broken
				Dreams", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording.</p>

			<p class="about_txt">In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was
				nominated for
				three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter
				two.
				The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility.
				Members of the band have also collaborated together on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, The
				Network,
				Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot and The Coverups.</p>
