	<h2>About</h2>
	<p><strong>Nirvana</strong> was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. Founded by lead singer
		and
		guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably
		Chad
		Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were
		often
		referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to
		influence modern rock and roll culture.</p>

	<p>In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album,
		<b><i>Bleach</i></b>, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on
		dynamic
		contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in
		1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with <b>"Smells Like Teen Spirit"</b>, the first single from
		their
		landmark second album <b><i>Nevermind (1991)</i></b>. A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s,
		<b><i>Nevermind</i></b>
		was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.</p>

	<p>Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of
		abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992
		compilation
		album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, <b><i>In
			Utero
			(1993)</i></b>. The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana
		disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic,
		Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best
		Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.</p>

	<p>Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. During
		their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as
		well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard
		Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In 2004, Rolling Stone named Nirvana
		among
		the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year
		of
		eligibility in 2014.</p>
